## Project Description
In this project, the back end for an e-commerce site was developed by working with the Express.js API and using Sequelize to configure and interact with a MySQL database. Thanks to the implementation of Sequelize, it was possible to implement different models and routes to perform CRUD operations in an efficient and robust way. In addition, different relationships amongst the models were established to link data from different columns.
